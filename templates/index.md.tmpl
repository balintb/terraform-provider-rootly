## Example Usage

## Development

### Generate Go types from Swagger

Use `make schema`.

### Auto-generate workflow task resources and tests from Swagger

Use `node tools/gen_tasks.js swagger.json`

The latest Swagger definition can be downloaded from rootly.com:

```sh
curl https://api.rootly.com/v1/swagger.json -o ./swagger.json
```

**Note**: The tests for tasks that depend on other resources will fail (ex: rootly_workflow_task_update_incident requires an incident ID). Not all tasks can be reliably auto-generated from Swagger.
