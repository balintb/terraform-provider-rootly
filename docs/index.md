# Rootly Provider

The [Rootly](https://rootly.com/) provider is used to interact with the resources supported by Rootly. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used. It requires terraform 0.14 or later.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform 0.12+ uses the Terraform Registry:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    rootly = {
      source = "rootlyhq/rootly"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Rootly provider
provider "rootly" {
  # We recommend using the `ROOTLY_API_TOKEN` env var to set the API Token
  # when interacting with Rootly's API.
  # api_token = var.rootly_api_key
}

# Terraform 0.12- can be specified as:
# provider "rootly" {
  # We recommend using the `ROOTLY_API_TOKEN` env var to set the API Token
  # when interacting with Rootly's API.
  # api_token = var.rootly_api_key
# }
```
